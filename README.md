# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jaguzmano09
I am an Electronics Engineering student at the National University of Colombia, passionate about embedded systems and machine learning. 
As a developer in training, I also have a strong interest in data science and how it can transform technology and solve real-world problems.

My goal is to contribute to these fields through innovative projects that combine hardware, software and data analysis, leaving a positive impact on the technology community.
